# OpenAI Docs

Provide current, cited OpenAI product, API, model, and Codex guidance. Read zero or one primary reference.

Use sources according to the task. For current model facts, pricing, APIs, or requested official citations, search the exact topic on official domains and open the relevant page. For local Codex configuration, skill discovery, installation, or troubleshooting, inspect the installed version, relevant files, and command help first, then use official documentation for unresolved behavior. Respect user-supplied URLs and avoid repeating searches for unchanged evidence already fetched in this conversation.

For generic software tasks, answer the software task directly. OpenAI implementation, debugging, SDK, API, prompting, agent, and eval requests are not generic.

For a straightforward factual or citation-only request, follow the source order and do not read a route reference. This includes straightforward API facts, ChatGPT Work or mixed Chat/Work/Codex comparisons, model tiers, aliases, Pro mode, reasoning settings, factual migration baselines, and narrow Codex facts. Prioritize `learn.chatgpt.com` for ChatGPT Work.

## Choose one primary route

Use the first matching route, and read its reference only when the requested task needs that specialized workflow:

- **Explicitly requested local documentation integration:** Read [integration guidance](references/mcp-diagnostics.md) only when the user explicitly requests that local integration.
- **Model migration, upgrades, or model-specific prompting:** Read [model-migration.md](references/model-migration.md) for actual migration planning, implementation, dynamic target resolution, or prompt changes. Preserve an explicitly requested target.
- **Model selection and comparisons:** Read [model-selection.md](references/model-selection.md) only when nuanced current, latest, default, cost, latency, quality, or modality tradeoffs need more guidance. Do not run a migration resolver for selection alone.
- **Product, API, ChatGPT Work, and mixed Chat/Work/Codex documentation:** Read [official-docs.md](references/official-docs.md) only when fetched official pages leave source selection, API schemas, or the requested implementation unresolved. This route is not manual-first.
- **Explicitly broad Codex setup, orientation, or cross-topic synthesis:** Read [codex-self-knowledge.md](references/codex-self-knowledge.md) when the eligible Codex manual or deeper Codex procedures are needed.

Read at most one primary reference. Do not open every route, bundled model guide, or helper script. Read a supporting reference or run a helper only when the chosen workflow demonstrably needs it.

## Source and execution boundaries

- Prefer `developers.openai.com`, `platform.openai.com`, and `learn.chatgpt.com`; use `openai.com` for official announcements and the official `openai` GitHub organization when source code is needed. Cite the page that supports the claim. State uncertainty when official sources do not establish pricing, availability, account access, limits, or behavior.
- Preserve an explicitly requested model for selection, migration, and prompting. Resolve an unspecified latest or current migration target only after searching and fetching current official guidance.
- Use `references/latest-model.md` only as a disclosed fallback after current official model guidance does not answer the question. Read `references/upgrading-to-gpt-6-astra.md` only for an actual, requested GPT-6 migration; read `references/prompting-guide.md` only for requested prompting work.
- Before building, running, editing, debugging, or testing an API-backed app or tool, use `openai-platform-api-key` first when available. Documentation, conceptual examples, model selection, and read-only guidance do not require an API key.
- Say "OpenAI Docs" or "official OpenAI documentation" in user-facing answers. Keep exact official citations and examples concise.
